#DNS resolving!

I wanted to understand how the DNS (Domain Name System) works, and more
specifically what my computer is actually doing when it translates a url
like `en.wikipedia.org` in an ip address.

I decided to write this program in Python using a literate style. After
implementing a [hash table](https://github.com/aliceriot/hashtable) in
C and realizing the value of writing about the process as I go I wanted to
write a more contained document, with source code and markup in the same
file.

Anyway, that file is [pyresolve.md](./pyresolve.md). Instructions for
running the literate Python and so on are in there.

Hooray literate programming!
